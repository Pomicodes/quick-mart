9.Future Enhancements 
To further enhance functionality, scalability, and user experience, the following improvements are proposed for future versions of Quick Mart: 
 
 
Back-end Integration:  Implement a full backend using Node.js and MongoDB or Firebase for dynamic product data, user authentication, and persistent storage. 
Payment Gateway Integration:  Enable secure online payment using services such as Stripe, Razorpay, or PayPal. 
Advanced Search & Filters:  Provide filters (e.g., price range, brand, color, size) to restrict product discovery. 
Push Notifications:  Notify users about offers, new arrivals, and cart reminders. 
User Reviews & Ratings:  Allow users to review products and provide star ratings for better buyer decisions. 
Order Tracking:  Enable real-time order status and delivery tracking within the profile. 
Admin Panel:  Develop a web-based admin dashboard for product and order management. 
Multilingual Support:  Expand accessibility by adding support for multiple languages and regions. 
 
9.1 Some of Future Integrations 
Real-time database with Firebase or MongoDB 
Online payment gateways (Stripe, Razorpay) 
Push notifications and order tracking 
 
 
 
 
9.2 Alignment with Project Objectives and User Needs 
These enhancements aim to strengthen Quick Martâ€™s value by improving usability, performance, and scalability, aligning with the needs of fast-paced mobile users and modern shopping expectations. 
 
9.3 Technical Restrictions 
Device Fragmentation: Variations in screen sizes and OS versions across Android and iOS devices required thorough cross-device testing. 
Gesture Consistency: Swipe gestures needed precise implementation using react-native-gesture-handler to avoid misfires or accidental actions. 
Navigation Stack Limits: Edge cases like back-navigation in deep navigation stacks required handling to prevent cras 
State Persistence: Without a full back-end, preserving state (cart, favorites) across sessions had technical limitations in the MVP version. 
 
9.4 Operational Restrictions 
No Backend Integration (MVP): 
Due to scope, real-time backend operations like order tracking, payment processing, and inventory management were not implemented. 
Manual Authentication Simulation: Login/logout flows are handled via mock logic, restricting real user validation or data persistence. 
Static Product Data: Shoe listings are statically defined in the app. Dynamic updates via a database are a planned enhancement. 
 
 
9.5 Strategic Restrictions 
Focus on Shoes Only: The app is intentionally scoped to sell only shoes to maintain brand clarity and UX simplicity. 
 
Limited Checkout Flow: Payment gateway and shipping functionality are omitted in the MVP, simplifying development but limiting commercial use. 
Offline Functionality: The app currently does not support offline browsing or caching, which limits usability without internet access.
